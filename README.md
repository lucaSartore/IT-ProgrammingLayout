# IT-ProgrammingLayout

This repository contains a custom layout made for italian programmers

The layout is based on the US one, so it has easy access to keys like: `\` and `~`, but it has some custom key bindings for the italian accented letters... In particular:

 - `á` is done with `altgr + a`
 - `é` is done with `altgr + e`
 - `í` is done with `altgr + i`
 - `ó` is done with `altgr + o`
 - `ú` is done with `altgr + u`
 - `Á` is done with `altgr + shift + a`
 - `É` is done with `altgr + shift + e`
 - `Í` is done with `altgr + shift + i`
 - `Ó` is done with `altgr + shift + o`
 - `Ú` is done with `altgr + shift + u`
 - `à` is done with `altgr + z`
 - `è` is done with `altgr + d`
 - `ì` is done with `altgr + k`
 - `ò` is done with `altgr + l`
 - `ù` is done with `altgr + i`
 - `À` is done with `altgr + shift + z`
 - `È` is done with `altgr + shift + d`
 - `Ì` is done with `altgr + shift + k`
 - `Ò` is done with `altgr + shift + l`
 - `Ù` is done with `altgr + shift + i`

 the second part of the layout may seems a little random at first, until you realize that is just one letter below in the qwerty layout, so for example `z` is below `a`
